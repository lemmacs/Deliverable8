This repository contains files of our projects in further description as well as a list of our prior deliverables.

We include a proper description of our database, what it caters to, and who our targets are. We also describe the problem description, which explains how travelers face issues that commonly occur in the process of planning our trips.

Deliverable8 delves into futher detail regarding domains, challenges, and solutions. We describe specific challenges travelers commonly face, what our solutions would be towards each challenge, and how that helps us determine our entities and domain in the project.
